# Hybrid-Issue-Formater
Hybrid Issue-Formater Is made to Remove some of the gathering of information to make it easier to make and report issues to hopefully make it so people dont get lazy and not report or report without required information.
# Suppoorted Software
Will Support most if not all hybrids 1.12.2 and up, First working version should support magma 1.12.2+ and ketting 1.20.2+

# UNSUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS
Magma: 1.12.2 - Does Not have the API nodes I need Would require me to add them But as magma is now dead this would not be added so will no implement
